## SALDRU Weekly Seminar Series

SALDRU hosts a [weekly in-person seminar series](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/events/category/seminars/
) at the School of Economics at UCT, where local and visiting scholars present research broadly in the fields of Labour and Development Economics. Seminars are generally open to the public; sign up [here](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/seminar-mailing-list/) if you would like to be added to the external mailing list.  

I currently convene the 2025 seminar series. If you would like to present your own research, please [email me](mailto:joshua.budlender@uct.ac.za). While SALDRU does not generally provide funding to present at the weekly seminar series, if your research fits into our thematic areas we can provide an invitation letter with which you can apply for travel or conference funding from your own institution.

## SALDRU December Workshop

I am also a co-organizer of the SALDRU December Workshop, an annual workshop held each December at UCT, organised by SALDRU. The aim of the December workshop is to encourage overseas-based researchers to present frontier Economics research in South Africa, as well as provide a venue for local researchers to engage with and present this kind of work.

The inaugural edition of the workshop was held in December 2024, and we believe it was a [great success](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2025/01/30/inaugural-edition-of-the-saldru-december-workshop/). You can find the programme [here](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/11/21/saldru-december-workshop-2024-programme/) and (previous, now-closed) 2024 call for papers [here](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/10/03/saldru-december-workshop-2024/#:~:text=SALDRU%20will%20be%20hosting%20a,the%20University%20of%20Cape%20Town).

The call for papers for the 2025 workshop should go out early in the second quarter of 2025. If you have any questions about the workshop or would like to be added to an email list to ensure you receive the call for papers, please [email me](mailto:joshua.budlender@uct.ac.za).
