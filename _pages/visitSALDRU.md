## SALDRU Weekly Seminar Series

SALDRU hosts a [weekly in-person seminar series](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/events/category/seminars/
) at the School of Economics at UCT, where local and visiting scholars present research broadly in the fields of Labour and Development Economics. Seminars are generally open to the public; sign up [here](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/seminar-mailing-list/) if you would like to be added to the external mailing list.  

I co-convene the 2026 seminar series with [Amy Thornton](https://saldru.uct.ac.za/contacts/amy-thornton). If you would like to present your own research, please [email us](mailto:joshua.budlender@uct.ac.za,amy.thornton@uct.ac.za). While SALDRU does not generally provide funding to present at the weekly seminar series, if your research fits into our thematic areas we can provide an invitation letter with which you can apply for travel or conference funding from your own institution.

## SALDRU December Workshop

I am also a co-organizer of the SALDRU December Workshop, an annual workshop held each December at UCT, organised by SALDRU. The aim of the December workshop is to encourage overseas-based researchers to present frontier Economics research in South Africa, as well as provide a venue for local researchers to engage with and present this kind of work.

The [2025 SALDRU-ERSA December Workshop](https://saldru.uct.ac.za/articles/2025-10-22-saldru-ersa-december-workshop-2025) has been generously supported by and is co-hosted with [Economic Research Southern Africa](https://econrsa.org) (ERSA). After 200 paper submissions, the workshop now has a confirmed line-up, with Taryn Dinkelman and Joe Kaboski presenting keynote lectures. For full details, including the list of speakers, please see [here](https://saldru.uct.ac.za/articles/2025-10-22-saldru-ersa-december-workshop-2025). Registration is now closed, but if you wuold like to attend, feel free to [email me](mailto:joshua.budlender@uct.ac.za).

The inaugural edition of the workshop was held in December 2024, and we believe it was a [great success](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2025/01/30/inaugural-edition-of-the-saldru-december-workshop/). You can find the programme [here](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/11/21/saldru-december-workshop-2024-programme/).
