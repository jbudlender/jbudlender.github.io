## Software

* * *

[A short note](/largedatastata) with some tips I've put together for working with "large" datasets in Stata, which links to other resources.

[Stata2R](https://stata2r.github.io/) from [Kyle Butts](https://www.kylebutts.com/), [Nick Huntington-Klein](https://nickchk.com/) and [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) provides a very helpful introduction to `data.table` and `fixest` in R, primarily designed for Stata users.  

[Grant McDermott's](https://grantmcdermott.com/) [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec510-2020-spring/lectures) course is an excellent introduction to tools such as Git and tasks such as webscraping.  

[Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham](https://paulgp.github.io/) has a [useful guide](https://paulgp.substack.com/p/setting-up-github-copilot-and-vscode) for setting up and using Github Copilot in VS Code, for R, Stata (YMMV), and Latex.
