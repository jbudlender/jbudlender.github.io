**When do employers share? Rent sharing, monopsony and minimum wages** with Ihsaan Bassier  
<small>[[Latest public version](/assets/pdf/rentsharing.pdf) | [2025 CEP Discussion Paper](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp2134.pdf)]  
When firm productivity or product demand rises, workers typically share in the gains through higher wages or expanded employment. We show that for firms under monopsony with a binding minimum wage, this link from firm gains to worker outcomes breaks sharply. Revenue-productivity improvements raise revenues but not wages or employment: firms simply maintain the minimum wage and absorb the gains into higher wage markdowns. We find compelling evidence for these predictions using South African administrative data, based on a cross-sectional kink design as well as within-firm responses to internal and shift-share trade shocks.  These results reveal a previously overlooked monopsonistic margin---productivity-induced markdown adjustment---and we show using a structural model that this substantially diminishes the intended returns of policies such as employment subsidies.

**Surviving in the dark: the mortality effects of reducing rolling blackouts**  
<small>[[WIDER/SA-TIED Working Paper](https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Working-paper/PDF/wp2024-44-surviving-in-the-dark-mortality-effects-reducing-rolling-blackouts.pdf) | [SALDRU Newsletter article](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/07/25/less-load-shedding-fewer-deaths/) | [WIDERAngle Blogpost](https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/tale-two-cities-can-electricity-supply-save-lives-without-deepening-divides/)]  
South Africa frequently experiences rolling blackouts ("load shedding") due to shortfalls
in electricity generation. This is a common problem across the developing world, and yet the
developmental impacts of insufficient and unstable electricity supply, and the benefits of mitigating
this, are poorly understood. I use the introduction of a unique load shedding reduction policy in
parts of South Africa’s second-largest city, Cape Town, to investigate the mortality effects of load
shedding and its mitigation. To identify these effects, I use a stacked synthetic control design that
leverages the episodic nature of load shedding between 2014 and 2019. While the estimates are
imprecise, I find robust evidence that the mitigation policy statistically significantly reduces
mortality in Cape Town relative to other parts of South Africa experiencing unmitigated load
shedding. The incomplete geographic coverage of the mitigation policy entrenches existing
inequalities in the city.
