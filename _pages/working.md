**When do employers share? Rent sharing, monopsony and minimum wages** with Ihsaan Bassier  
<small>[[Latest public version](/assets/pdf/rentsharing.pdf)]  
When firms experience productivity increases or better demand conditions, they tend to share the benefits with their workers. An increasingly favoured explanation for such rent sharing is labour market monopsony. But what happens when firms also face binding minimum wages, as is empirically common? In our theoretical model, when a monopsonistic firm's preferred wage lies just below the mandated minimum, it will neither raise wages (share rents) nor expand employment following a local revenue-productivity increase. Instead, the firm maintains the minimum wage and absorbs the additional revenue into a higher markdown. We find compelling evidence for these predictions using South African administrative data, based on a cross-sectional kink design as well as within-firm responses to internal and shift-share trade shocks. Our results demonstrate a novel monopsonistic mechanism in the labour market, and also highlight a potential disconnect between the level of rent sharing and the pass-through.

**Surviving in the dark: the mortality effects of reducing rolling blackouts**  
<small>[[WIDER/SA-TIED Working Paper](https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Working-paper/PDF/wp2024-44-surviving-in-the-dark-mortality-effects-reducing-rolling-blackouts.pdf) | [SALDRU Newsletter article](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/07/25/less-load-shedding-fewer-deaths/) | [WIDERAngle Blogpost](https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/tale-two-cities-can-electricity-supply-save-lives-without-deepening-divides/)]  
South Africa frequently experiences rolling blackouts ("load shedding") due to shortfalls
in electricity generation. This is a common problem across the developing world, and yet the
developmental impacts of insufficient and unstable electricity supply, and the benefits of mitigating
this, are poorly understood. I use the introduction of a unique load shedding reduction policy in
parts of South Africaâ€™s second-largest city, Cape Town, to investigate the mortality effects of load
shedding and its mitigation. To identify these effects, I use a stacked synthetic control design that
leverages the episodic nature of load shedding between 2014 and 2019. While the estimates are
imprecise, I find robust evidence that the mitigation policy statistically significantly reduces
mortality in Cape Town relative to other parts of South Africa experiencing unmitigated load
shedding. The incomplete geographic coverage of the mitigation policy entrenches existing
inequalities in the city.
