**Rent sharing, wage floors and development** with Ihsaan Bassier  
<small>[[Latest version](/assets/pdf/rentsharing.pdf) | [WIDER working paper](https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Working-paper/PDF/wp2023-132-rent-sharing-wage-floors-development.pdf)]  
Faced with more favorable demand conditions, many firms raise wages. However,
we show that firms with labour market power, lower productivity, and binding wage
floors will absorb these positive revenue-productivity shocks as excess profits instead
of increasing wages or employment. Our prediction follows from a simple but novel
theoretical insight under a standard framework of monopsonistic competition, and
we empirically test this theory in South Africa using firm-level administrative data.
We first explain how firm wage-setting behavior changes at a productivity threshold
directly related to the wage floor, and then show how the predicted wage, employment
and profit patterns are evident in the cross-section of firms covered by collective
bargaining agreements. We then replicate and extend a leading method of identifying
rent-sharing elasticities, but estimated separately by firm revenue-productivity
bins. As predicted by the theory, we find that firms below the threshold increase
wages and employment less, and profits more, in response to revenue-productivity
shocks, and that there is a break at the threshold where wage floors bind. The study
complicates the conclusions emerging from the literature on firm rent-sharing, and
forms part of an explanation for “stalled” development and “jobless growth”.
