**Rent sharing, wage floors and development** with Ihsaan Bassier  
<small>[[Latest version](/assets/pdf/rentsharing.pdf)]  
Faced with more favorable demand conditions, many firms raise wages. However,
we show that firms with labour market power, lower productivity, and binding wage
floors will absorb these positive revenue-productivity shocks as excess profits instead
of increasing wages or employment. Our prediction follows from a simple but novel
theoretical insight under a standard framework of monopsonistic competition, and
we empirically test this theory in South Africa using firm-level administrative data.
We first explain how firm wage-setting behavior changes at a productivity threshold
directly related to the wage floor, and then show how the predicted wage, employment
and profit patterns are evident in the cross-section of firms covered by collective
bargaining agreements. We then replicate and extend a leading method of identifying
rent-sharing elasticities, but estimated separately by firm revenue-productivity
bins. As predicted by the theory, we find that firms below the threshold increase
wages and employment less, and profits more, in response to revenue-productivity
shocks, and that there is a break at the threshold where wage floors bind. The study
complicates the conclusions emerging from the literature on firm rent-sharing, and
forms part of an explanation for “stalled” development and “jobless growth”.

**Surviving in the dark: the mortality effects of reducing rolling blackouts**  
<small>[[WIDER/SA-TIED Working Paper](https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Working-paper/PDF/wp2024-44-surviving-in-the-dark-mortality-effects-reducing-rolling-blackouts.pdf) | [SALDRU Newsletter article](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/07/25/less-load-shedding-fewer-deaths/) | [WIDERAngle Blogpost](https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/tale-two-cities-can-electricity-supply-save-lives-without-deepening-divides/)]  
South Africa frequently experiences rolling blackouts ("load shedding") due to shortfalls
in electricity generation. This is a common problem across the developing world, and yet the
developmental impacts of insufficient and unstable electricity supply, and the benefits of mitigating
this, are poorly understood. I use the introduction of a unique load shedding reduction policy in
parts of South Africa’s second-largest city, Cape Town, to investigate the mortality effects of load
shedding and its mitigation. To identify these effects, I use a stacked synthetic control design that
leverages the episodic nature of load shedding between 2014 and 2019. While the estimates are
imprecise, I find robust evidence that the mitigation policy statistically significantly reduces
mortality in Cape Town relative to other parts of South Africa experiencing unmitigated load
shedding. The incomplete geographic coverage of the mitigation policy entrenches existing
inequalities in the city.
