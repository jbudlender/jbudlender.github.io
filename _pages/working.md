**When do employers share? Rent sharing, monopsony and minimum wages** with Ihsaan Bassier  
<small>[[Latest public version](/assets/pdf/rentsharing.pdf)]  
How do firms bound by minimum wages respond to productivity increases or more favorable demand conditions? While the literature shows that firms generally share revenue-productivity increases with workers in the form of higher wages or employment, we find that this dynamic weakens substantially for lower-productivity firms which are just-constrained by minimum wages. Using a monopsony framework, we predict a "kink" in the wage-productivity curve: firms just below this productivity threshold pay the minimum wage and absorb revenue-productivity gains as profits, without wage or employment increases, while firms above the threshold exhibit normal rent-sharing behavior. We test for and find strong evidence of this mechanism using South African tax data, based on a cross-sectional kink design as well as within-firm responses to internal and shift-share trade shocks on either side of the productivity threshold. Our paper highlights how rent-sharing and inclusive growth more generally are contingent on how firms respond to constraints which reduce their monopsony rents.

**Surviving in the dark: the mortality effects of reducing rolling blackouts**  
<small>[[WIDER/SA-TIED Working Paper](https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Working-paper/PDF/wp2024-44-surviving-in-the-dark-mortality-effects-reducing-rolling-blackouts.pdf) | [SALDRU Newsletter article](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/07/25/less-load-shedding-fewer-deaths/) | [WIDERAngle Blogpost](https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/tale-two-cities-can-electricity-supply-save-lives-without-deepening-divides/)]  
South Africa frequently experiences rolling blackouts ("load shedding") due to shortfalls
in electricity generation. This is a common problem across the developing world, and yet the
developmental impacts of insufficient and unstable electricity supply, and the benefits of mitigating
this, are poorly understood. I use the introduction of a unique load shedding reduction policy in
parts of South Africaâ€™s second-largest city, Cape Town, to investigate the mortality effects of load
shedding and its mitigation. To identify these effects, I use a stacked synthetic control design that
leverages the episodic nature of load shedding between 2014 and 2019. While the estimates are
imprecise, I find robust evidence that the mitigation policy statistically significantly reduces
mortality in Cape Town relative to other parts of South Africa experiencing unmitigated load
shedding. The incomplete geographic coverage of the mitigation policy entrenches existing
inequalities in the city.
