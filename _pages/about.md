Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am an Economics PhD Candidate at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/economics/), 
and a Research Fellow at the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research 
Unit ([SALDRU](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/)) at the University of Cape Town.

My work is in Labour and Development Economics, using Applied Microeconometrics methods. I have a particular interest in exploring the role of firms in the development process and in determining wages and employment.  

I have also done economic advisory work on social grant policy for the South African Presidency and National Treasury. 
Other interests include the economic history and long-run effects of racial discrimination in South Africa, and the developmental impacts of governance failures in South Africa today.
