I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit ([SALDRU](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/)) at the University of Cape Town.  

My work is in Labour and Development Economics, using Applied Microeconometrics methods. I have a particular interest in exploring the role of firms in the development process and in determining wages and employment.  

I have also done economic advisory work on social grant policy for the South African Presidency and National Treasury. 
Other interests include the economic history and long-run effects of racial discrimination in South Africa, and evaluating the developmental impacts of policy successes and failures in South Africa today. 

I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in June 2024, under the primary supervision of Arindrajit Dube.
