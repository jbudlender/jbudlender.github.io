I am a co-organizer of the SALDRU December Workshop, an annual workshop held each December at the University of Cape Town. The aim of the December workshop is to encourage overseas-based researchers to present frontier Economics research in South Africa, as well as provide a venue for local researchers to engage with and present this kind of work.

The call for papers for the 2024 workshop is now closed, but see the [previous call](https://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/2024/10/03/saldru-december-workshop-2024/#:~:text=SALDRU%20will%20be%20hosting%20a,the%20University%20of%20Cape%20Town.) for more information about the workshop. The workshop programme will be posted shortly.

If you are interested in attending the 2024 workshop as an audience member, or have questions about the 2025 workshop, please feel free to get in touch with me.
